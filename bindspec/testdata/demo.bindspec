# Statement syntax: selector... action
# selectors:
#     pkg regex      - package name
#     name regex     - identifier name
#     not selector   - negate selector
#     * Regexes always require a full match.
#
# actions:
#     rename new-name - rename selected name to new-name
#     to-kebab        - rename selected name to kebab case
#     exclude         - exclude selection from binding generation
#     * An action's new-name may use backreferences (e.g. \1)
#       from the preceding selectors.
#
# A statement is always terminated by an action. The parser fully
# ignores line breaks (except for comments) and indentation.

# Exclude some bindings
pkg fyne\.io/fyne/v2/(tools/playground|test)
    exclude

# Strip New prefix
name New([[:upper:]].*) # this is a comment
    rename \1

# Rename functions named New to their package name,
# e.g. fyne.io/fyne/v2/app.New => app.App
pkg (.*)/([^/]*)
    name New
    rename \2

# Turn all identifiers into kebab case
name .*
